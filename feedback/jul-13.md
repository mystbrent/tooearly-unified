# Page:
Not y-axis and x-axis scrollable.

# Job Results Container of Job Cards:

Job search container should be scrollable in y-axis.


# Job Card:

Make job card smaller, otherwise they take up to much space.

Clicking job card will open side drawer with job details.

Since detail is not available such as benefits and requirement we can’t really show them. Also it would require LLM calls to extract Key requirements and benefits..

We can stick to original idea of showing job full details in side drawer opening like upwork.

and see how it will work it out later with job descriptions we have.

Replace Save as PDF button with Go to Job URL link and when clicked it will open the job in new tab.

Add in card share job button that when clicked will dropdown a share link to the job.

Add in card Not Interested button.

Add in card detail work type: Full Time, Part Time, Contract, Internship, Freelance, etc.

Add in card detail location: London, Remote, Hybrid, etc.

Add in card detail company logo: Google, Apple, etc.

Add in card detail company stage: Early Stage, Growth Stage, Late Stage, Public, etc.

Add in card Industry: Technology, Finance, Healthcare, etc. Sometimes can be specific like: Cloud Computing - Database

Add in card when was posted: 5 hours ago,1 day ago, 1 week ago, 1 month ago, etc.

Add in card detail position: Entry level, Mid level, Senior level, Director, etc.

Add in card detail salary: £100,000 - £120,000 per year, etc.

Add in card detail company name: Google, Apple, etc.




# Filter Sidebar:

Hidden by default.

Can be opened by clicking on the filter icon in the top right corner ensure to put in a strategic good UX space for it.

Filters also I would prefer to come from side drawer. we can perhaps just remove right side bar as it is very narrow and filters don’t really fit properly. Same for filters in left side bar. Should be just nav bar.

We are already showing active filters on top. and give a change button in same bar which will open side drawer similar to job right

Key requirement looks good though to show on front directly. if we can somehow.

other stuff also we can just remove. i.e. Visa, salary calculator and TFL zones. these are all good ideas however probably for later stage? and specially it won’t work properly if we want to try to go international all at once.

also location/work type- London (remote/hybrid) better to be split so it’s cleary visible.
