# EPIC: UK Discovery Mode - Minimum Lovable Product Launch

## Epic Overview
**Focus**: UK-First Market Launch Strategy for Discovery Mode  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks  
**Market**: United Kingdom (NOT United States)  
**Product Strategy**: Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) approach

## Strategic Rationale

### Why UK First?
1. **Market Testing Ground**: Lower risk validation before US expansion
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: UK employment law familiarity and GDPR alignment
3. **Cultural Alignment**: English-speaking market with distinct professional culture
4. **Competitive Landscape**: Less saturated than US market (LinkedIn, Indeed dominance)
5. **Brexit Impact**: Talent mobility changes creating new job search behaviors

### MLP vs MVP Philosophy
- **Minimum Lovable Product**: Focus on user delight and engagement from day one
- **Core functionality** with polished UX rather than feature completeness
- **Quality over quantity**: Fewer features executed exceptionally well
- **User feedback loop**: Rapid iteration based on UK user behavior patterns
