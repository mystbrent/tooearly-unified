# Gamified Job Seeker Profile Management - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Transform the traditional job seeker profile page into an engaging, Netflix-like gamified experience that makes job searching feel motivating and fun rather than a boring task, while maintaining all existing functionality and data integrity.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current profile page: Traditional form-based profile (`components/profile-page.tsx`)
- Technology stack: Next.js 15.2.4, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- Integration points: Airtable for user data, existing authentication system
- Current "Get Hired Faster with Turbo" button needs replacement with gamified approach

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being added/changed:** Complete UI/UX overhaul to Netflix-style interface with gamification elements including progress tracking, achievement badges, community features, and reward systems
- **How it integrates:** Builds upon existing profile data structure, enhances current components rather than replacing core functionality
- **Success criteria:** Users report increased engagement, motivation, and completion rates for profile sections and job applications

**Product Vision:**
Make job search fun like watching Netflix through:
- **Progress Gamification:** Visual progress bars, completion streaks, daily goals
- **Achievement System:** Badges for milestones (applications sent, interviews scheduled, profile completion)
- **Community Features:** Public shoutouts for interview achievements, peer encouragement
- **Reward Mechanics:** Loot boxes with networking opportunities, agency collaborations, career resources
- **Netflix-Style UI:** Card-based layouts, smooth animations, personalized recommendations

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing React/Next.js job seeker profile system
- Integration points: Existing profile data structure, Airtable backend, authentication system
- Existing patterns to follow: Radix UI components, Tailwind CSS styling, TypeScript interfaces
- Critical compatibility requirements: Preserve all existing profile functionality, maintain data integrity, ensure mobile responsiveness
- Each story must include verification that existing profile management capabilities remain intact while adding the gamification layer

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering a Netflix-like, gamified job search experience that makes users feel motivated and engaged."

## Additional Context

**Current Pain Points Addressed:**
- Traditional, boring profile interface → Netflix-style engaging experience
- Lack of motivation during job search → Achievement and progress systems
- Isolated job search experience → Community features and peer support
- Generic "Turbo" promotion → Integrated gamified upgrade path

**User Journey Enhancement:**
1. **Traditional State:** User sees boring form-based profile
2. **Gamified State:** User sees progress dashboard, achievements, and community
3. **Engagement:** User motivated by badges, streaks, and peer recognition
4. **Retention:** User returns daily for goals, community interaction, and rewards

This epic transforms job searching from a mundane task into an engaging experience that users actually want to participate in, similar to how Netflix makes content consumption addictive through personalization and engagement mechanics.
