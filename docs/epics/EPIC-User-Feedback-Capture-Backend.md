# EPIC: User Feedback Capture Backend Service

**Epic ID:** EPIC-001  
**Created:** 2025-07-02  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** backend, api, feedback, airtable, brownfield

## Epic Goal

Implement a robust backend service that securely captures user feedback from the job aggregator platform's UI, enriches it with visitor geolocation data, and stores it in Airtable with duplicate prevention to enable data-driven product decisions.

## Business Context

The current frontend feedback collection system (implemented in commit `ba2b957`) successfully captures user preferences on work type, job layout, and right panel content. However, without a backend service, we cannot:
- Persistently store feedback data for analysis
- Prevent duplicate submissions
- Enrich feedback with visitor context
- Ensure data integrity and security

This epic addresses these gaps by implementing a comprehensive backend solution.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current functionality:** Frontend UI collecting user feedback on work type preferences, job layout, and right panel content
- **Technology stack:** Web-based job aggregator platform with existing UI components
- **Integration points:** Frontend feedback collection, external Airtable database, IP geolocation services

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added:** Secure backend API service for processing feedback submissions with automatic visitor data enrichment and duplicate prevention
- **How it integrates:** RESTful API endpoint that receives frontend submissions, enriches with geolocation data, implements deduplication logic, and stores in structured Airtable format
- **Success criteria:** 100% feedback capture rate, zero duplicate entries per user/question combination, sub-500ms response time, privacy-compliant data handling

## Stories

| Story ID | Title | Story Points | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| STORY-001 | Implement Core Feedback API Endpoint with Data Validation | 8 | Ready for Development |
| STORY-002 | Develop Visitor Data Enrichment and Geolocation Service | 5 | Ready for Development |
| STORY-003 | Build Airtable Integration with Duplicate Prevention Logic | 8 | Ready for Development |

**Total Story Points:** 21

## Technical Requirements

### Airtable Schema Mapping
The backend service will map feedback data to the following Airtable structure:

| Column Name | Type | Description | Required |
|-------------|------|-------------|----------|
| Feedback_ID | Text (UUID) | Primary key for each submission | Yes |
| User_ID | Text | Session-based ID for anonymous users | Yes |
| Question_Type | Text | "Work Type", "Job Layout", "Right Panel Content" | Yes |
| Answer | Text | Selected option from UI | Yes |
| Custom_Answer | Text | Free text input when applicable | No |
| Timestamp | DateTime | ISO 8601 UTC format | Yes |
| Country | Text | IP-based geolocation | Yes |
| City | Text | IP-based geolocation | No |
| IP_Address | Text | SHA256 hashed for privacy | No |
| User_Agent | Text | Browser/device identification | No |

### API Specification

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/feedback`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "session_12345",
  "question_type": "Work Type",
  "answer": "Blue Collar",
  "custom_answer": null,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-02T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "feedback_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "message": "Feedback recorded successfully"
}
```

### Deduplication Strategy
- Query existing records by `User_ID + Question_Type` combination
- Update existing record with new answer and timestamp (captures preference evolution)
- 24-hour window for considering duplicates

### Security & Privacy Requirements
- API key authentication for endpoint access
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse (10 requests per minute per IP)
- Input validation against injection attacks
- IP address hashing (SHA256) before storage
- GDPR/CCPA compliant data handling
- Secure transmission over HTTPS only

## Acceptance Criteria

### Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All user feedback is successfully captured and stored in Airtable
- [ ] No duplicate entries exist for same user/question combinations within 24-hour window
- [ ] API response time is consistently under 500ms
- [ ] Visitor geolocation data is accurately captured for 95%+ of submissions
- [ ] Privacy compliance verified through security audit
- [ ] Zero data loss during normal operations
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging implemented

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** < 500ms for 95th percentile
- **Throughput:** Support 100 concurrent feedback submissions
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime during business hours
- **Data Accuracy:** 100% feedback capture rate, 95%+ geolocation accuracy

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Data Privacy Violations**
   - **Impact:** Legal compliance issues, user trust damage
   - **Mitigation:** Implement privacy-by-design, hash sensitive data, conduct security review
   - **Owner:** Backend Development Team

2. **Feedback Data Loss**
   - **Impact:** Loss of valuable user insights, poor user experience
   - **Mitigation:** Implement transaction-based operations, comprehensive error handling, monitoring
   - **Owner:** Backend Development Team

### Medium Risks
1. **API Performance Degradation**
   - **Impact:** Poor user experience, increased bounce rate
   - **Mitigation:** Implement caching, optimize database queries, load testing
   - **Owner:** DevOps Team

2. **Third-party Service Dependencies**
   - **Impact:** Service disruption if geolocation API fails
   - **Mitigation:** Implement fallback strategies, circuit breakers, monitoring
   - **Owner:** Backend Development Team

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Frontend feedback collection system (already implemented)
- Authentication/authorization system
