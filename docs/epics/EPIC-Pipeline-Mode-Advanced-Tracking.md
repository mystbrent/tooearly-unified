interface AdvancedPipelineData {
  jobs: EnhancedJobWithOutcomes[];
  userPerformanceMetrics: {
    overallSuccessRate: number;
    stageConversionRates: Record<string, number>;
    averageTimeInStage: Record<string, number>;
    negotiationSuccessRate: number;
    interviewPreparationCorrelation: number;
  };
  
  aiInsights: {
    pipelineHealthScore: number;
    recommendedActions: AIAction[];
    successPredictions: Record<string, number>;
    marketIntelligence: MarketData;
  };
  
  gamificationState: {
    currentLevel: number;
    xpTotal: number;
    achievementsUnlocked: Achievement[];
    performanceBasedRewards: Reward[];
    learningInsights: Insight[];
  };
}

interface EnhancedJobWithOutcomes extends Job {
  outcomes: {
    applicationDate?: Date;
    firstResponse?: Date;
    interviewDates: Date[];
    offerReceived?: boolean;
    offerAmount?: number;
    finalOutcome: 'hired' | 'rejected' | 'withdrawn' | 'pending';
  };
  
  aiInsights: {
    successProbability: number;
    recommendedActions: string[];
    marketPosition: 'below' | 'at' | 'above' market;
    timingOptimality: number;
  };
}
```

### Smart Pipeline Analytics
```typescript
class PipelineAnalytics {
  calculatePipelineHealth(jobs: EnhancedJobWithOutcomes[]): number {
    const stageDistribution = this.getStageDistribution(jobs);
    const activityRecency = this.getActivityRecency(jobs);
    const successProbability = this.aggregateSuccessProbabilities(jobs);
    
    return (stageDistribution * 0.4 + activityRecency * 0.3 + successProbability * 0.3);
  }
  
  generatePersonalizedInsights(userHistory: UserOutcomeHistory): Insight[] {
    return [
      this.analyzeSuccessPatterns(userHistory),
      this.identifyImprovementAreas(userHistory),
      this.suggestOptimalTiming(userHistory),
      this.benchmarkAgainstPeers(userHistory)
    ];
  }
  
  predictOutcome(job: Job, userProfile: UserProfile): PredictionResult {
    // ML model trained on anonymized user outcome data
    return this.outcomeModel.predict(job, userProfile);
  }
}
```
