# STORY-002: Develop Visitor Data Enrichment and Geolocation Service

**Story ID:** STORY-002  
**Epic:** EPIC-001 - User Feedback Capture Backend Service  
**Created:** 2025-07-02  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Labels:** geolocation, enrichment, privacy, backend

## User Story

**As a** product manager analyzing user feedback  
**I want** visitor geographical and technical context automatically added to feedback submissions  
**So that** I can understand user preferences by location and device type while maintaining privacy compliance

## Story Description

This story implements the visitor data enrichment service that automatically captures and processes visitor context information for each feedback submission. The service extracts IP-based geolocation data, processes user agent information, and applies privacy-compliant data handling before enriching the feedback payload for storage.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Geolocation Service Integration
- [x] **AC-001:** IP geolocation service integrated (ip-api.com or equivalent)

- [x] **AC-004:** Fallback handling for failed geolocation lookups
- [x] **AC-005:** Geolocation API response time under 100ms for 90% of requests

### Privacy-Compliant Data Processing
- [x] **AC-006:** IP addresses hashed using SHA256 before any storage
- [x] **AC-007:** Original IP addresses never logged or stored in plain text
- [x] **AC-008:** Geolocation data limited to country/city level (no precise coordinates)
- [x] **AC-009:** User agent data sanitized to remove personally identifiable information
- [x] **AC-010:** GDPR/CCPA compliance validated through privacy review

### User Agent Processing
- [x] **AC-011:** Browser name and version extracted from user agent string
- [x] **AC-012:** Operating system information extracted
- [x] **AC-013:** Device type classification (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [x] **AC-014:** User agent parsing handles malformed or unusual agent strings gracefully
- [x] **AC-015:** Processed user agent data stored in standardized format

### Data Enrichment Integration
- [x] **AC-016:** Enrichment service integrates with API endpoint from Story 1
- [x] **AC-017:** Enriched data added to feedback payload before downstream processing
- [x] **AC-018:** Enrichment failures don't block feedback submission
- [x] **AC-019:** Enrichment process adds less than 50ms to total API response time
- [x] **AC-020:** Enrichment service supports concurrent processing for multiple requests

### Error Handling & Resilience
- [x] **AC-021:** Circuit breaker pattern implemented for geolocation API failures
- [x] **AC-022:** Graceful degradation when geolocation service unavailable
- [x] **AC-023:** Retry logic for transient geolocation API failures
- [x] **AC-024:** Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting enrichment failures
- [x] **AC-025:** Monitoring alerts for enrichment service health

## Technical Requirements

### Geolocation Service Configuration

**Primary Service:** ip-api.com (or equivalent)
- Endpoint: `http://ip-api.com/json/{ip}`
- Rate limit: 1000 requests per hour (free tier)
- Response time: < 100ms typical

**Fallback Service:** Alternative geolocation provider for redundancy

**Request Format:**
```javascript
const geoRequest = {
  url: `http://ip-api.com/json/${hashedIP}`,
  fields: 'status,message,country,city,query',
  timeout: 2000
};
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "country": "United States",
  "city": "New York",
  "query": "192.168.1.1"
}
```

### Privacy Implementation

#### IP Address Hashing
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function hashIP(ipAddress) {
  const salt = process.env.IP_HASH_SALT;
  return crypto.createHash('sha256')
    .update(ipAddress + salt)
    .digest('hex');
}
```

#### Data Minimization Rules
- Store only country and city (no region, ISP, or coordinates)
- Hash IP addresses immediately upon receipt
- Remove or sanitize identifying information from user agents
- Implement data retention policies (max 2 years)

### User Agent Processing

#### Parsing Logic
```javascript
const userAgentParser = require('ua-parser-js');

function processUserAgent(userAgentString) {
  const parser = new userAgentParser();
  const result = parser.setUA(userAgentString).getResult();
  
  return {
    browser: `${result.browser.name} ${result.browser.version}`,
    os: `${result.os.name} ${result.os.version}`,
    device_type: result.device.type || 'desktop',
    sanitized_ua: sanitizeUserAgent(userAgentString)
  };
}
```

#### Sanitization Rules
- Remove version numbers that might be too specific
- Replace unusual or custom user agent strings with generic categories
- Limit stored user agent length to 200 characters

### Enrichment Service Architecture

#### Service Interface
```javascript
class VisitorEnrichmentService {
  async enrichFeedback(feedbackData, requestMetadata) {
    const enrichedData = {
      ...feedbackData,
      visitor_context: await this.gatherVisitorContext(requestMetadata)
    };
    return enrichedData;
  }
  
  async gatherVisitorContext(metadata) {
    const [geoData, userAgentData] = await Promise.all([
      this.getGeolocation(metadata.ip),
      this.processUserAgent(metadata.userAgent)
    ]);
    
    return {
      country: geoData.country,
      city: geoData.city,
      ip_hash: this.hashIP(metadata.ip),
      ...userAgentData,
      enrichment_timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }
}
```

#### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```javascript
const CircuitBreaker = require('opossum');

const geoOptions = {
  timeout: 2000,
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
  resetTimeout: 30000,
  fallback: () => ({ country: 'Unknown', city: null })
};

const geoCircuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(getGeolocation, geoOptions);
```
