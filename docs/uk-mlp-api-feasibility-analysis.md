# UK MLP API Feasibility Analysis & Revised Feature Specifications

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of free APIs and services available for the UK Discovery Mode MLP launch, based on research conducted in January 2025. It identifies feasible features, recommends removing complex/expensive features, and provides specific implementation guidance for the revised prototype.

**Key Finding**: A viable MLP can be built using free UK APIs, but certain features must be removed or simplified to maintain feasibility and budget constraints.
