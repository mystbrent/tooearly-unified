# Gather Context Task

This task systematically collects comprehensive project context before beginning any design work.

## Purpose
Ensure all design decisions are informed by a complete understanding of business goals, user needs, technical constraints, and project requirements.

## Process

### 1. Project Overview

Ask the following questions:

**Basic Information:**
- What is the name of this project?
- What type of product is this? (Web app, mobile app, website, etc.)
- What is the primary purpose of this product?
- Who is the client/stakeholder?
- What is the project timeline?
- What phase are we in? (Discovery, Design, Development, Launch)

**Project Scope:**
- What features/sections are included in this phase?
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- Are there future phases planned?

### 2. Business Context

**Business Goals:**
- What are the top 3-5 business objectives?
- How will success be measured? (KPIs, metrics)
- What is the business model? (SaaS, e-commerce, content, etc.)
- What is the target market size?

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Who are the main competitors?
- What differentiates this product?
- Are there industry standards to follow?
- What are users currently using instead?

**Constraints:**
- Budget constraints?
- Timeline constraints?
- Resource constraints?
- Legal/regulatory requirements?

### 3. User Context

**Target Audience:**
- Who are the primary users? (demographics, profession, tech-savviness)
- Who are the secondary users?
- What are their main goals?
- What are their pain points with current solutions?

**User Research:**
- Has user research been conducted? (interviews, surveys, analytics)
- What were the key findings?
- Do we have user personas defined?
- What are the main user journeys?

**Use Cases:**
Primary use cases (list top 5):
1. [Use case 1]
2. [Use case 2]
3. [Use case 3]
4. [Use case 4]
5. [Use case 5]

### 4. Technical Context

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend framework/library?
- Backend technology?
- Database system?
- Hosting/deployment platform?
- Third-party integrations?

**Technical Constraints:**
- Browser support requirements?
- Device support requirements?
- Performance requirements?
- Accessibility standards? (WCAG level)
- Security requirements?

**Existing Systems:**
- Are we building from scratch or improving existing?
- What systems need to integrate?
- Are there legacy system constraints?
- API limitations?

### 5. Design Context

**Brand Guidelines:**
- Is there an existing brand guide?
- Logo usage rules?
- Color palette restrictions?
- Typography guidelines?
- Tone of voice?

**Design Preferences:**
- Examples of designs they like?
- Examples of designs they dislike?
- Specific style direction? (minimal, playful, professional, etc.)
- Any design elements to avoid?

**Existing Design Assets:**
- Previous designs or wireframes?
- Design system or component library?
- Icon set preferences?
- Image/illustration style?

### 6. Content Context

**Content Strategy:**
- Who creates/manages content?
- How often is content updated?
- What types of content? (text, images, video, etc.)
- Localization requirements?

**Content Volume:**
- How many pages/screens?
- How many products/items/articles?
- Expected growth rate?

### 7. Special Requirements

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG compliance level?
- Specific accessibility needs?
- Testing requirements?

**Performance:**
- Page load time targets?
- Interaction responsiveness needs?
- Offline functionality?

**Other Requirements:**
- Multi-language support?
- Print stylesheets?
- Email templates?
- Dark mode?

## Context Summary Template

After gathering information, summarize:

```
PROJECT CONTEXT SUMMARY

Constraints:
- Timeline: [Date]
- Budget: [If relevant]
- Technical: [List]

Success Criteria:
- [Metric 1]
- [Metric 2]
- [Metric 3]
```

## Questions to Validate Understanding

Before proceeding with design:
1. Do I understand the primary user need we're solving?
2. Are the business goals clear and measurable?
3. Do I know all technical constraints?
4. Is the scope clearly defined?
5. Do I have enough information to make design decisions?

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Conflicting stakeholder goals
- Unrealistic timeline expectations
- Missing user research
- Undefined success metrics
- Scope creep indicators
- Technical limitations discovered late

## Next Steps

After gathering context:
1. Confirm understanding with stakeholder
2. Identify any information gaps
3. Create project brief if needed
4. Begin information architecture
5. Start initial sketches/wireframes

## Notes

- Always document context for future reference
- Update context as project evolves
- Share context with all team members
- Use context to justify design decisions
